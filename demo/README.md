This is a demo of [sti-renderer](https://github.com/notnullgames/sti-renderer).

It's not really a complete game demo, it just shows how the player can be under & over things, depending on which is in "front". FOr your own, you'd probly want to add collision and do a lot more.

## asset credits

I got the terrain assets from [here](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-tile-atlas) and created the player with [universal sprites](https://notnullgames.github.io/universal-sprites/).
