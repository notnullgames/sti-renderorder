This is a demo of [sti-renderer](https://github.com/notnullgames/sti-renderorder).

It's not really a complete game demo, it just shows how the player can be under & over things, depending on which is in "front". For your own, you'd probly want to improve collision and do a lot more.

I did add basic collisions, to add some realism to the behavior. It's a little weird in the map-editor, as it blocks out the shape of the player sprite, so the bottom of collision-zones need to not block the head. This could probly be improved with some math in the collision updates, but I didn't bother.

## asset credits

I got the terrain assets from [here](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-tile-atlas) and created the player with my [universal sprites](https://notnullgames.github.io/universal-sprites/).
